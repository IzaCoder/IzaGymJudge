        <p><strong>Target 10</strong> breaks down <em>deductions</em> for WDP (formerly JO) levels 1 to 5. <strong>Target 10s</strong> have illustrations of how each skill is supposed to look, along with things the gymnast can do to raise their score. Each deduction is color-coded by amount, and is the gymnast can achieve to improve their score (e.g., “straight legs” instead of “bent legs”).</p>
        <p><strong>Routine Makers</strong> help you create Xcel routines for each event that meet all <em>Special Requirements</em> (SRs).</p>
